### Project Title
Udacity Programming for Data Science - Bike Share Project

### Description
This Python script has been developed as part of the main project for the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree program. The script can be used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major US cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) for the first six month of the year 2017. It imports data from three respective csv files containing data for the particular cities and computes descriptive statistics from the data for a specific date the user can specify. Additionally, upon request lines of raw data can be provided.

### Files used
chicago.csv  
new_york_city.csv
